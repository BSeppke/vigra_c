Commit 2871bfbb4578caffc8a8fe64cf8f8b46e0ff7f94

** Interface changes

vigra_nonLocalMean_c:

  This new function maps the undocumented vigra function
  for non-local mean filtering. Simple straight-forward
  wrapping, but (however) untested yet.

Commit 91a0bc3a0fc249f5eb96506eacb74e5633242f60

** Interface changes

** New interfaces

vigra_clipimage_c:

  This new function clips the image pixels values' to a given
  lower and upper value.

** New deprecations

** Bug fixes

vigra_exportgrayimage_c:
vigra_exportrgbimage_c:
vigra_exportrgbaimage_c:

  Those functions will now clip the images from 0...255 if the
  parameter rescale_range is set to false, like it is said in
  the corresponding documentation. Before, they just type
  casted the floats to uchars, which resulted in ugly overflows.

** Performance improvements

vigra_convert_grayband_to_argb_c:
vigra_convert_rgbbands_to_argb_c:
vigra_convert_rgbabands_to_argb_c:

  Since these functions also perform casts from float to uchar, 
  they now also clip the values to 0..255 before casting. Adapted
  the documentation as well.

Commit a38f36151643a415c5a42280909263078f73c802

** Interface changes

vigra_extractfeatures_gray_c:
vigra_extractfeatures_rgb_c:

  Respectively 22 and 34 features are now derived.  The arr_out vector
  size must be, respectively, (n-region + 1) * 22 and (n-region + 1) *
  34, since features are derived for the background 'region' as well.

Commit c2f35f7bd85764cdd4e9acd4050d3d6ea16acf89

** Interface changes:

vigra_exportgrayimage_c:
vigra_exportrgbimage_c:
vigra_exportrgbaimage_c:

  New argument: rescale_range (booloean)

  When true, the range of intensity values is rescaled from min..max to
  0..255 for most image formats, which only support 8bit (per channel).

  When false, rounded intensity are stored, if the float values lie
  within the 0..255 range, otherwise, values are set to 0 when below the
  range and 255 when above.
