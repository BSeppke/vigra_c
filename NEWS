Commit a38f36151643a415c5a42280909263078f73c802

** Interface changes

vigra_extractfeatures_gray_c:
vigra_extractfeatures_rgb_c:

  Respectively 22 and 34 features are now derived.  The arr_out vector
  size must be, respectively, (n-region + 1) * 22 and (n-region + 1) *
  34, since features are derived for the background 'region' as well.

Commit c2f35f7bd85764cdd4e9acd4050d3d6ea16acf89

** Interface changes:

vigra_exportgrayimage_c:
vigra_exportrgbimage_c:
vigra_exportrgbaimage_c:

  New argument: rescale_range (booloean)

  When true, the range of intensity values is rescaled from min..max to
  0..255 for most image formats, which only support 8bit (per channel).

  When false, rounded intensity are stored, if the float values lie
  within the 0..255 range, otherwise, values are set to 0 when below the
  range and 255 when above.
