* Interface changes:

Added more features to the vigra_extractfeatures_gray_c function: Now, 22 features per region are derived. Thus, the array handed over to this function needs to be of size (regions+1)*22

Added more features to the vigra_extractfeatures_rgb_c function: Now, 34 features per region are derived. Thus, the array handed over to this function needs to be of size (regions+1)*34

Changes at Sep 4, 2017 (c2f35f7bd85764cdd4e9acd4050d3d6ea16acf89)

* Interface changes:

Added one additional boolean argument "rescale_range" to the functions:
vigra_exportgrayimage_c
vigra_exportrgbimage_c
vigra_exportrgbaimage_c

If set to true, the range of intensity values is rescaled from min..max to 0..255 for most image formats, which only support 8bit (per channel). If not, rounded intensity are stored, if the float values lie within 0..255. Else, 0 or 255 if above or below the range.
